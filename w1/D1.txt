Hi, I am Sagar Nepali. In my undergraduate, I studied Web Technology in my fourth semester (2013). 
After my undergraduate, I was working as a java developer and had to modify the JSP as and when required. 
In those periods, I have been able to be aware of Web servers, clients, servers, javascript, jquery, ajax,
http, REST, JSP and many more web related contents.

-> This lab assignment was easy. It took me around and hour to finish the assignment. With previous experience
with git and github, I found it relatively easy to publish the github page. However, after publishing the 
assignment and rechecking, I found that the html validator was not working even doing the same as instructed. 
It says, no referrer header found. Here's the link to the github: https://sagarnepali.github.io/WAP/
