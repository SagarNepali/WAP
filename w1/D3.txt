Hi, I am Sagar Nepali. In my undergraduate, I studied Web Technology in my fourth semester (2013). 
After my undergraduate, I was working as a java developer and had to modify the JSP as and when required. 
In those periods, I have been able to be aware of Web servers, clients, servers, javascript, jquery, ajax,
http, REST, JSP and many more web related contents.

-> About me page was easy and did it quickly. But took some time to do advance topics of the recipe. Had 
to google few things like adding favicon, with icon for <li> tags. Nesting unordered list inside ordered 
list seemed easy but with validator, an error was shown. When an empty li was uses to wrap the ul inside 
ol and doing the li visibility to none. Tried all extra options. However I cannot make the paragraph look 
reversed when hover.
