Hi, I am Sagar Nepali. In my undergraduate, I studied Web Technology in my fourth semester (2013). 
After my undergraduate, I was working as a java developer and had to modify the JSP as and when required. 
In those periods, I have been able to be aware of Web servers, clients, servers, javascript, jquery, ajax,
http, REST, JSP and many more web related contents.

-> The problems were easy as we just covered functional programming from MPP as well. I used to struggle to understand
the functional style of programming, as it was used so much in javascript codes. The JS timer took me some time 
as I had to search for it in the internet  as well and added a font using googleapis to show the font as like in 
digital clock
