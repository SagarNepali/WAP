Hi, I am Sagar Nepali. In my undergraduate, I studied Web Technology in my fourth semester (2013). 
After my undergraduate, I was working as a java developer and had to modify the JSP as and when required. 
In those periods, I have been able to be aware of Web servers, clients, servers, javascript, jquery, ajax,
http, REST, JSP and many more web related contents.

-> For this movie-review web page, I find it hard to make the columns and things to show up in its own position
like review boxes, general overview, page information and banners as well. In comparision to previous assignments,
this is quite hard as we are not using any CSS frameworks as well as other grids or flexbox for alignments. As most 
parts are completed in this assignments, few formatting things still remaining. Like, user information in review box.
